# Lambda

> Lambda calculus was introduced by Alonzo Church in 1930s.

* Based on mathematical notation for lambda-calculus functions (__anonymous functions__).
* In 1950s, John McCarthy invented _LISP_ at MIT, that models mathmeatical problems `(lambda (arg) (* arg arg))`.

```java
(Type param1, Type param2, ...) => {
    // ...
    return something;
}

(Type param1) => something >= param1
```
