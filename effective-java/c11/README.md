# Serialization

*Object Serialization* concerns Java's framework for encoding objects as byte streams (*serializing*) and reconstructing objects from their encodings (*deserializing*). Once an object has been serialized, its encoding can be sent from one VM to another or stored on disk for later deserialization.

These items focus on the dangers of serialization and how to minimize them.
