# 74: Document all exceptions thrown by each method

* It is critically important that you take the time to carefully document all of the exceptions thrown by each method ([Item 56](../56)).

* Always **declare checked exceptions individually**, and document precisely the conditions under which each one is thrown using the Javadoc `@throws` tag.

* Use the Javadoc `@throws` tag to document each exception that a method can throw, **but do _not_ use the throws keyword on unchecked exception**. The documentation generated by the Javadoc `@throws` tag without a corresponding throws clause in the method declaration provides a strong visual cue to the programmer than an exception is unchecked.

* If an exception is thrown by many methods in a class for the same reason, you can document the exception in the class's documentation comment.
