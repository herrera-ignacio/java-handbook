# JVM: Java Virtual Machine

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine

The __Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is detailed by a specification__ that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation. Having a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations so that program authors using the Java Development Kit (JDK) need not worry about idiosyncrasies of the underlying hardware platform.

The JVM __reference implementation is developed by the OpenJDK project as open source code and includes a JIT compiler called HotSpot__. The commercially supported Java releases available from Oracle Corporation are based on the OpenJDK runtime. Eclipse OpenJ9 is another open source JVM for OpenJDK.
