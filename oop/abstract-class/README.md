# Abstract Class

* Non-instantiable class that defines a __common protocol__ for subclasses.

* Abstract class __should be extended__.

* Abstract methods must be overriden, can't be static.

* _Abstract Subclass_ need not override abstract methods but can override methods, or define abstract & concrete methods.

* _Concrete Subclass_ must override unimplemented abstract methods.

See [code example](../code/basics/oop/src/abstract_classes).
