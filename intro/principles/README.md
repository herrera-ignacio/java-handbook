# Five Principles

There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:

1. It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.

2. It must be robust and secure.

3. It must be architecture-neutral and portable.

4. It must execute with high performance.

5. It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.
