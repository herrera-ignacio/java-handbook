# 59: Know and use the libraries

* Every programmar should be familiar with the basics of `java.lang`, `java.util`, and `java.io`, and their subpackages. Knowledge of other libraries can be acquired on an as-needed basis.

* Several libraries bear special mentions. The **Collections** framework and the **Streams** library should be part of every programmer's basic toolkit, as should parts of the concurrency utilities in `java.util.concurrent`.

* **Don't reinvent the wheel**. By using a standard library, you take advantage of the knowledge of the experts who wrote it and the experience of those who used it before you.

> e.g., for most users, `Random` is no longer used but instead, the random number generator of choice is now `ThreadLocalRandom`.

* Numerous features are added to the libraries in every major release, and it pays to keep abreast of these additions.
