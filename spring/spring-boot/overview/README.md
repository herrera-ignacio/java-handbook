## Overview

> Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

It takes an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss.

## Advantages

* Create stand-alone Spring applications

* Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)

* Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration

* Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible

* Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration

* Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration

## Running App

It can be run standalone:

```
java -jar myapp.jar
```

## Deplying App

Can be deployed in the traditional way, deploying *WAR* file to an external server: Tomcat, JBoss, WebSphere, etc...
