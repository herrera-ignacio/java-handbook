# Objects

Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: __they consist of state and related behavior__.

An object __stores its state in fields and expose its behavior through methods__. Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.

Hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's method is known as __data encapsulation__.
