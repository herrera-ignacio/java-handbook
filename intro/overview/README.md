# Java

Java is a programming language designed as:

* Class-based, object-oriented.
* General purpose
* __WORA__: _Write once, run anywhere_.
* Have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

Java applications are typically compiled to _bytecode_ that can run on any _Java Virtual Machine_ (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

Java was originally developed by _James Gosling_ at _Sun Microsystems_ (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystem's Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in cimplaince with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Oracle offers its own HotSpot JVM, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.
