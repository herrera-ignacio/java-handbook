# Apache Kafka

Kafka combines three key capabilities so you can implement your *use cases* for *event streaming* end-to-end with a single solution:

1. To **publish** (write) and **subscribe to** (read) streams of events, including continuous import/export of your data from other systems.

2. To **store** streams of events durably and reliably for as long as you want.

3. To **process** streams of events as they occur or retrospectively.

And all this functionality is provided in a distributed, highly scalable, elastic, fault-tolerant, and secure manner. Kafka can be deployed on bare-metal hardware, virtual machines, and containers, and on-premises as well as in the cloud. You can choose between self-managing your Kafka environments and using fully managed services offered by a variety of vendors.
