# Classes and Interfaces

*Classes* and *interfaces* are the **basic units of abstractions** of the Java programming language. The language provides many powerful elements that you can use to design classes and interfaces.

These items contain guideliens to help you make the best use of these elements so that your classes and interfaces are **usable**, **robust**, and **flexible**.
