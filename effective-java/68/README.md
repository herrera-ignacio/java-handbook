# 68: adhere to generally accepted naming conventions

* The Java platform has a well-established set of *naming conventions*, many of which are contained in *The Java Language Specification*. Loosely speaking, naming conventions fall into two categories: **typographical** and **grammatical**.

* Typographical naming conventions cover packages, classes, interfaces, methods, fields, and type variables. You should rarely violate them and never without a very good reason. If an API violates these conventions, it may be difficult to use. If an implementation violates them, it may be difficult to maintain. In both cases, **violates have the potential to confuse and irritate other programmers who work with the code and can cause faulty assumptions that lead to errors**.

* Grammatical naming conventions are more flexible and more controversial. To quote from *The Java Language Specification*, "These conventions should not be followed slavishly if long-held conventional usage dictates other wise." Use common sense.
