# Packages

A package is a __namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces__. Conceptually you can think of packages as being similar to different folders on your computer.

> Because software written in the Java programming language can be composed of hundreds or thousands of individual classes, it makes sense to keep things organized by placing related classes and interfaces into packages.
